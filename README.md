This program is an APRS tracker running on T-Echo modules.
It requires the arduino IDE, installation of the RadioLib library and TinyGPS+.
Pressing the user button turns the module on when it is off.
Simultaneous pressing of the user and touch button turns off the module.
A short press on the touch button illuminates the screen.
A long press on the touch button requests the transmission of an APRS frame.
Pressing the user button allows you to activate or deactivate the tracker (transmission of APRS frames).
This tracker has reception, and transmits only if the frequency is free, to avoid frame collisions.

I was inspired by other programs to write this one.
